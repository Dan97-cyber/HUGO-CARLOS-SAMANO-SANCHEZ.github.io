About us


In the SAMANO Lab we study how proteins interact to each other. In particular, we are interested in how secreted proteins from pathogens evolve functional sites. 


We combine evolution, computational structural biology and wet lab methods to predict and validate protein-protein interactions and functions.

Our group just started at the end of 2024 so we are recruiting at all levels, visit our [recruitment page](https://person.zju.edu.cn/samano#recruitment).
