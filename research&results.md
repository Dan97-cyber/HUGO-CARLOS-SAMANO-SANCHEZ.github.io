# Computational Infection Biology

The core question being explored in our research is how cutting-edge computational structural biology approaches can help predict and assess protein-protein interactions testable in wet lab experiments with a minimum false positive rate. 

To achieve this, evolutionary patterns, big data, AI-based algorithms and experimental validations are organically integrated.
